## Introduction

# A.
Hello! My name is Ben. I'm a junior web developer, novelist, and copyeditor by trade. I *love* cats, coffee, and esoteric knowledge. My **favorite** thing in the world, however, is a merge request with file conflicts.

# B.
I'm already familiar with everything discussed here, having completed the Code Labs program this last semester and growing accustomed to using Git in a terminal and Github both personally and collaboratively.

# C.
To whoever is reading this, if you know of dev internships or volunteer opportunities to build websites and software on campus, I would be so grateful to hear about them!
